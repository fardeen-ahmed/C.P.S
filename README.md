<img src="https://github.com/fardeen-ahmed/C.P.S/blob/main/Critical%20Port%20Scanner.png" alt="None" align="center" height="100" width="1000">
<h3> Requirements :-
    
    1) python & python3
    2) requests (for better performance)
    3) sys   

This project aims for:-
```
1) Finding One's device's open ports.
2) Can be used as an OSINT Tool.
```
<h3> This scanner is for people targeting specific ports like :-</h3>

```
    -FTP (21): FTP or File Transfer Protocol is used to transfer files across the Internet. 
    
    -SSH (22): SSH or Secure Shell carries out the task of remotely connecting to a server or host, allowing you to execute a number of commands and move files. 
    
    -Telnet (23): Telnet establishes a connection between a server and a remote computer.
    
    -SMTP (25): SMTP or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ensures email messages are communicated over the network securely.
    
    -WHOIS (43): Used to obtain the registration of ownership of domain names and IP addresses 
    
    -DNS (53): DNS or Domain Name System uses relational databases to link the hostnames of computers or networks to their respective IP addresses. 
    
    -DHCP (67, 68): DHCP or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol assigns IP Address related information to clients on a network automatically. This information may       
     be comprised of subnet mask, IP address, etc. Port 67 performs the task of accepting address requests from DHCP and sending data to the server, while port 68 
     responds to all requests of DHCP and forwards the data to the client.
    
    -TFTP (69): TFTP or Trivial File Transfer Protocol is a simple lockstep File Transfer Protocol that allows a client to get a file from or put a file onto a 
    remote host. One of its primary uses is in the early stages of nodes booting from a local area network.
    
    -HTTP (80): Assigned to web servers and directly associated with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
    
    -POP3 (110): POP3 or the Post Office Protocol is used by email clients to retrieve data from remote email servers.
    
    -SFTP (115): SFTP or Secure File Transfer Protocol, is a separate protocol packaged with SSH that works in a similar way over a secure connection
    
    -IMAP (143): IMAP or Internet Message Access Protocol retrieves emails from a remote server without having the need to download the email. 
    
    -SNMP (161): SNMP or Simple Network Management Protocol is used to collect and organize information about managed devices on IP networks and for modifying 
    that 
    information to change device behavior. 
    -HTTPS (443): Allows you to connect to the Internet by establishing a secure connection between web pages and the browser. 
    
    -LPD (515): LPD or Line Printer Daemon Protocol is a networking printing protocol for submitting jobs to a remote printer.
    
    -rsync (873): rysnc is used to transfer and synchronize files between a computer and external hard drive, and across networked computers by comparing the 
    modification times and sizes of files. 
    
    -IMAP SSL (993): IMAP protocol that supports SSL encryption.
    
    -POP3 SSL (955): POP3 protocol that supports SSL encryption.
    
    -SOCKS (1080): SOCKS or SOCKet Secure is an Internet protocol that exchanges network packets between a client and a server through a proxy server.
    
    -Proxy (3128): Currently the port often used by proxies.
    
    -MySQL (3306): Used by MySQL databases.
    
    -RDP (3389): RDP or Remote Desktop Protocol establishes a connection with a remote computer, allowing you to access it from anywhere in the world.
    
    -PostgreSQL (5432): Used by PostgreSQL databases.
    
    -VNC (5900): A graphical desktop-sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol (RFB) to remotely control another computer.
    
    -TeamViewer (5938): A proprietary software application for remote control, desktop sharing, online meetings, web conferencing, and file transfer between 
    computers. 
    
    -HTTP (8080): An alternate port for HTTP.
